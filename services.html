              <p>
                BPSS (Baseline Personnel Security Standard) Clearance is a security vetting process used primarily within the United Kingdom for individuals working in certain sensitive government or defense roles. This clearance is a pre-employment screening that ensures an individual is reliable, trustworthy, and suitable for the position.</p>
                <p>The process involves checking:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Basic DBS Check (Disclosure & Barring Service)
                    <p>A Basic DBS check helps ensure an individual has no unspent convictions, enhancing trust and safety in recruitment and decision-making processes.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ID Check
                    <p>An ID Check verifies the identity of an individual. ID checks are carried out to prevent fraud, check for illegal activity and fundamentally confirm that the person is who they claim to be.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Right to Work check
                    <p>This check confirms a person's legal right to work status. Failing to carry out sufficient right to work checks can result in fines and penalties, which can ultimately damage a company’s reputation.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3-Year Employment History Check
                    <p>This check verifies the employment history of an individual. The purpose of this check is to ensure that the information provided by the candidate regarding their previous employment is accurate and truthful.</p>
